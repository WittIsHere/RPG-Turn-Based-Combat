# History

# Polemic
Not gonna talk a lot about this subject. But the polemy is here. 
The main two points of view are:
1. Turn based combat is enjoyable. It is an interesting puzzle and since you are not limited by time, you can enjoy a more slow pace.
2. Turn based combat is boring. It is an outdated and therefore obsolete type of combat, it was great in the beggining, when games where limited by technology, but no longer enjoyable in the new generations.


# Examples and types of turn based combat
I have seen three main approaches, all under the category of RPG turn based combat. I am not using the pioneers of these styles, but well-known examples wo you all can get the main idea.
Since in this subject we are using the classic, I will only mention the other two here.

## Classic.
Pokemon, Octopath traveler, Final Fantasy (first games), and many many others.



There exist many variations, but all share the same idea. We will talk about this later.

## Xcom-like
This one is more complex.

## Pit People-like

# What makes a turn based combat BAD?
 - It is extremly boring
 - You have to grind many and many fights that you know the result even before starting
 - There is always a bet choice, no room for taking meaningful decisions or approaches to the combat
 - Animations are long.

# What makes a turn based combat GOOD?
- All the elements are well thought and deepth
- There is a phylosophy why this game has this type of combat. There is a reason why it is the best option for the game
- Meaningful choices
- Rewarding
- Balanced
- Good design
- It innovates in some way

# Elements
First, I would like tot alk about a dichotomy. WE will first analyze the elements that we see (all that is related with the graphics and the UI) All that we see
And then, about the hidden elements
I will just mention and explain them briefly here, when designing our game we will learn how to use them.

## UI
- Turn's bar
- Entities (Players and enemies)
- Options menu
- Stats of the characters (HP, Mana...)

## Hidden
All that is related to the fight, but that is under the knowledge of the player. It can be prepared in advance (like what attacks, or what party are you using) or you will have to discover it yourself (monster attacks, weakness, stats, how to approach the fight...)

- Entities stats (not HP and MP, but damage, dodge, speed, weakness, types of attacks...)
- How is it supposed to play? Do you have different strategies?


# Loops
This is another layer to the combat, and specially usefull for programmers.

The turn based combat has several loops.

# Designing a simple turn based combat.

I divided the creation of a turn based combat into 5 simple steps.

1 - Unerstand what rol does the combat take into your game. Probably for this asignment it will be one of the game pilars, since its the main challenge that the player will have.
2 - Develop the entities: Playable characters and Enemies (mobs and bosses)
You have to define how do you want the player to approach the challenge, do you have classes? do you have to form a party?
Also, what stats o they have, and wich ones can the player interact with.
What attacks do they have?
3 - Create AI intelligence
4 - Design the UI and the art style
5 - Understand the different loops inside the game
6 - Think of at least one original mechanic.
